# Sudoku App

[Sudoku App](https://mikes-sudoku-app.tk)

A simple sudoku app built with pure JS, HTML and CSS, no backend.

The game includes the option to register and login, but the data will be gone once the app page is refreshed.

Fully suitable for mobile, desktop and everything in between.

## Getting Started

Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

To place the numbers, drag and drop them from the bottom line to the board.

To discard numbers from the board, just pick them up and move them away from the board borders.

### Prerequisites
